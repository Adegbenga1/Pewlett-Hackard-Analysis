   ## Summary
    
      * Ratio of total number of employees due for retirement :Total number of employees due for mentorship = 0.02 or 2%
      * More than 90,000 roles will be required to be filled . An indication that the organization has a very large number of
        employees . There is every possiblity that the project might imperil the success of the company because greater numbers 
        of experienced professionals will leave the company.Consequetly, knowledge management would be negatively impacted.
      * We do not have enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees
        It is important that the project is carried out in phases to prevent total departmental collapse and negative impact on company performance.
        Alternatively , the orgnization could support the project with latest technology that combines and automate some processes from different 
        departments and form a synergistic process for efficiency,effectiveness, growth and profitability
